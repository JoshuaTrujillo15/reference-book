# Reference Book

## Link will be included!

SO. If you look at my github, you will see my learning materials are inconsistently formatted, and a bit disorganized.

For my ease of use, I will be creating a reference book of programming languages on my website. This repository will include the source code. Anyone is welcome to use the reference as they please, but there are no guarantees ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO SECURITY. I am doing everything I can to only include secure code, but PHP brings pain upon my soul. 

### The Plan

First comes raw .txt files to hold the data. This will include extensive comments and will be standardized in regards to format in order to allow for queries later. The text files will be moved into a mysql database (commands to create database will be included in case someone wants to replicate this somewhere else). Each language will have their own table, and I will use PHP to generate dynamic web pages that correspond to each language (this is also great because I dont want to write SEPARATE html pages for this, I have stuff to do).

## Languages To Be Used

HTML, CSS, JS (maybe?), PHP, MySQL
